# Problem Statement
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
- You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
- The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
- You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
    - For these cities, you have the city population.
    
Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?

# Solution
The goal is to build a linear regression model to fit this data.
- With this model, we can then input a new city's population, and have the model estimate our restaurant's potential monthly profits for that city.
